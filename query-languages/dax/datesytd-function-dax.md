## Example

The following sample formula creates a measure that calculates the 'Running Total' for Internet sales.

```dax
= CALCULATE (
    SUM ( InternetSales_USD[SalesAmount_USD] ),
    DATESYTD ( DateTime[DateKey] )
)
```

The following sample formula creates a measure that calculates the 'Fiscal Year Running Total' for Internet sales, using a US Locale for the Date format.

```dax
= CALCULATE(
    SUM(InternetSales_USD[SalesAmount_USD]), 
    DATESYTD(DateTime[DateKey],
        "6-30"
        )
)
```

## Example for calendar based time intelligence

The following sample formula creates a measure that calculates the 'Running Total' for Internet sales uing fiscal calendar.

```dax
= CALCULATE (
    SUM ( InternetSales_USD[SalesAmount_USD] ),
    DATESYTD ( FiscalCalendar )
)
```
