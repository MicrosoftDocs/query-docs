# INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Returns a table with information about each [relationship](/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-create-and-manage-relationships) in the semantic model, such as name, cardinality, and cross-filtering behavior. This information helps you understand the model and to self-document the model when used in calculated tables. 

## Syntax

```dax
INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS()
```

## Return value

A table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| [ID] | The unique ID for each relationship in this semantic model as an integer. |
| [Name] | The name of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. Might be a GUID. |
| [Relationship] | The descriptive relationship name of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. Includes from table and column, to table and column, with cardinality and cross filter direction. |
| [Model] | The relationship's semantic model ID, usually a GUID. |
| [IsActive] | The is active property of each relationship in this semantic model as True or False. |
| [CrossFilteringBehavior] | The cross-filter behavior or direction of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [RelyOnReferentialIntegrity] | The rely on referential integrity property of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. Also called [assume referential integrity](/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-assume-referential-integrity) in the relationship editor, as it assumes all rows in the column in the many table have a match to a row in the one side table. |
| [FromTable] | The from table name of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [FromColumn] | The from column name of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [FromCardinality] | The from column cardinality of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [ToTable] | The to table name of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [ToColumn] | The to column name of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [ToCardinality] | The to column cardinality of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [State] | The state of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. |
| [SecurityFilteringBehavior] | The security filtering behavior of each relationship in this semantic model as a string. Important for row-level security roles. |


## Remarks

Can only be ran by users with write permission on the semantic model and not when live connected to the semantic model in Power BI Desktop. This function can be used in calculated tables, columns, and measures of a semantic model and will update when the model is refreshed.

## Example 1 - DAX query

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view):

```dax
EVALUATE
	INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS()
```

This DAX query returns a table with all of the columns of this DAX function.

## Example 2 - DAX query with SELECTCOLUMNS

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

```dax
EVALUATE
	SELECTCOLUMNS(
		INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS(),
		[Relationship],
		[IsActive]
	)
```

This DAX query returns a table with only the specified columns.

## Example 3 - calculated table with SELECTCOLUMNS

Either of the above examples work in a calculated table when the EVALUATE and ORDER BY keywords are removed and a table name added. Here is example 2 in a calculated table:

```dax
Relationships in this semantic model = 
SELECTCOLUMNS(
    INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS(),
    [Relationship],
    [IsActive]
)
```
This calculated table shows the same information as the DAX query in example 2 in a table in the model itself.

## Example 4 - measure

The following measure can be added to count the number of relationships in a semantic model:

```dax
Number of relationships = 
COUNTROWS( INFO.VIEW.RELATIONSHIPS() )
```
This will show a scalar value with the number of relationships in my model.

This can be shown in a visual:

Or a DAX query in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

```dax
DEFINE
    MEASURE 'Measures in this semantic model'[Number of measures] = COUNTROWS( INFO.VIEW.MEASURES() )

EVALUATE
    SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
        "Number of measures", [Number of measures]
    )
```
