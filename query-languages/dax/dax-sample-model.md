# DAX sample model

The **Adventure Works DW 2020** Power BI Desktop sample model is designed to support your DAX learning. The model is based on the [Adventure Works data warehouse sample](/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure#data-warehouse-downloads) for AdventureWorksDW2017â€”however, the data has been modified to suit the objectives of the sample model.

The sample model does not contain any DAX formulas. It does however support hundreds or even thousands of potential calculation formulas and queries. Some function examples, like those in CALCULATE, DATESBETWEEN, DATESIN PERIOD, IF, and LOOKUPVALUE can be added to the sample model without modification. We're working on including more examples in other function reference articles that work with the sample model.
