# INFO.VIEW.ANNOTATIONS

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-query-only](includes/applies-to-query-only.md)]

Returns a table with information about each column in the semantic model, such as name, description, and format string. This information helps you understand the model and to self-document the model when used in calculated tables. 

## Syntax

```dax
INFO.ANNOTATIONS([<Restriction name>, <Restriction value>], ...)
```

[!INCLUDE[parameters-for-info-dax-functions](includes/parameters-for-info-dax-functions.md)]

## Return value

A table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| [ID] | A reference to the object. IDs are usually autogenerated and should not be changed after the model is created. Data type is unsigned long (4 bytes). |
| [ObjectID] | A reference to the object that owns this Annotation. |
| [ObjectType] | A reference to the type of object that owns this Annotation. |
| [Name] | The name of the object, used in code, script, and queries. |
| [Value] | The value of the annotation. |
| [ModifiedTime] | The time that the object was last modified. |

## Remarks

Can only be ran by users with write permission on the semantic model and not when live connected to the semantic model in Power BI Desktop. This function can be used in DAX queries, and can't be used in calculations.

## Example 1 - DAX query

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view):

```dax
EVALUATE
	INFO.ANNOTATIONS()
```

This DAX query returns a table with all of the columns of this DAX function.

## Example 2 - DAX query with joins

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

```dax
EVALUATE
	VAR _ObjectTypeEnum =
	DATATABLE(
	"ObjectType",INTEGER,
	"Object",STRING,
	{
	{0,"Null"},
	{1,"Model"},
	{2,"DataSource"},
	{3,"Table"},
	{4,"Column"},
	{5,"AttributeHierarchy"},
	{6,"Partition"},
	{7,"Relationship"},
	{8,"Measure"},
	{9,"Hierarchy"},
	{10,"Level"},
	{11,"Annotation"},
	{12,"KPI"},
	{13,"Culture"},
	{14,"ObjectTranslation"},
	{15,"LinguisticMetadata"},
	{29,"Perspective"},
	{30,"PerspectiveTable"},
	{31,"PerspectiveColumn"},
	{32,"PerspectiveHierarchy"},
	{33,"PerspectiveMeasure"},
	{34,"Role"},
	{35,"RoleMembership"},
	{36,"TablePermission"},
	{37,"Variation"},
	{38,"Set"},
	{39,"PerspectiveSet"},
	{40,"ExtendedProperty"},
	{41,"Expression"},
	{42,"ColumnPermission"},
	{43,"DetailRowsDefinition"},
	{44,"RelatedColumnDetails"},
	{45,"GroupByColumn"},
	{46,"CalculationGroup"},
	{47,"CalculationItem"},
	{48,"AlternateOf"},
	{49,"RefreshPolicy"},
	{50,"FormatStringDefinition"}
	}
	)

	VAR _INFO =
	INFO.ANNOTATIONS()

	VAR _CombinedTable =
	NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN(
		_INFO,
		_ObjectTypeEnum
	)

	VAR _ModelObjects =
	UNION(
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.MEASURES(),
			"ObjectID", [ID],
			"Object Name", [Name]
		),
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.TABLES(),
			"ObjectID", [ID],
			"Object Name", [Name]
		),
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.COLUMNS(),
			"ObjectID", [ID],
			"Object Name", [ExplicitName]
		),
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.EXPRESSIONS(),
			"ObjectID", [ID],
			"Object Name", [Name]
		),
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.MODEL(),
			"ObjectID", [ID],
			"Object Name", [Name]
		)
	)

	VAR _CombinedTable2 =
	NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN(
		_CombinedTable,
		_ModelObjects
	)

	RETURN
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			_CombinedTable2,
			"Object type", [Object],
			"Object", [Object Name],
			"Annotation name", [Name],
			"Annotation value", [Value]
		)
	ORDER BY [Annotation name]
```

This DAX query returns a table with only the specified columns and joining to other INFO DAX functions and the enumeration table.
