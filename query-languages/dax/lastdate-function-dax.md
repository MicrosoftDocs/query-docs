# LASTDATE

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations-discouraged](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations-discouraged.md)]

For date column input, returns the last date in the current context for the specified column of dates.  

For calendar input, returns the last date based on the calendar.

## Syntax

```
LASTDATE(<dates> or <calendar>)
```

### Parameters

|Term|Definition|
|--------|--------------|
|`dates or calendar`|A column that contains dates or a calendar reference|

## Return value

For date column input, a table containing a single column and single row with a date value.

For calendar input, a table containing a single column and single row with a date value.

## Remarks

- The `dates` argument can be any of the following: 
  - A reference to a date/time column,
  - A table expression that returns a single column of date/time values,
  - A Boolean expression that defines a single-column table of date/time values.

- Constraints on Boolean expressions are described in the topic, [CALCULATE function](calculate-function-dax.md).

- When the current context is a single date, the date returned by the FIRSTDATE and LASTDATE functions will be equal.

- For date column input, the Return value is a table that contains a single column and single value. Therefore, this function can be used as an argument to any function that requires a table in its arguments. Also, the returned value can be used whenever a date value is required.
