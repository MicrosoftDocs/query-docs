# COLUMNSTATISTICS

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations-discouraged](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations-discouraged.md)]

Returns a table of statistics regarding every column in every table in the model.

## Syntax

```dax
COLUMNSTATISTICS ()
```

### Parameters

This function does not take any parameters.

## Return value

A table of statistics. Each row of this table represents a different column in the model. Table columns include:

- **Table Name**: The current column’s table.
- **Column Name**: The current column’s name.
- **Min**: The minimum value found within the current column.
- **Max**: The maximum value found within the current column.
- **Cardinality**: The number of distinct values found within the current column.
- **Max Length**: The length of the longest string found within the current column (only applicable for string columns).

## Remarks

- Columns in an error state and columns from query-scope calculated tables do not appear in the result table.

- If a filter from the filter context is applied to COLUMNSTATISTICS(), an error is returned.


## Example

[!INCLUDE [power-bi-dax-sample-model](includes/power-bi-dax-sample-model.md)]

The following DAX query:

```dax
DEFINE
    TABLE FilteredProduct =
        FILTER (
            Product,
            [Color] == "Blue"
        )
    COLUMN Customer[Location] = [State-Province] & " " & [Country-Region]

EVALUATE
COLUMNSTATISTICS ()

```

Returns a table with statistics regarding all columns from all tables in the model. The table also includes statistics for the query-scope calculated column, Customer[Location]. However, the table does not include the columns from the query-scope calculated table, FilteredProduct.
