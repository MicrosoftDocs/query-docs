# INFO.TABLESTORAGES

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-query-only](includes/applies-to-query-only.md)]

Returns a table with information about all table storage in the semantic model. This information helps you understand the model.

## Syntax

```dax
INFO.TABLESTORAGES([<Restriction name>, <Restriction value>], ...)
```

[!INCLUDE[parameters-for-info-dax-functions](includes/parameters-for-info-dax-functions.md)]

## Return value

A table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| [ID] | A reference to the object. IDs are usually autogenerated and should not be changed after the model is created. Data type is unsigned long (4 bytes). |
| [TableID] | The ID of the table.|
| [Name] | The name of each table in this semantic model as a string followed by the table ID in paranthesis. |
| [Version] | |
| [Settings] | This column is for internal use only. |
| [RIViolationCount]| This is a deprecated column set to 0. |
| [StorageFolderID]| The ID of the storage folder that contains the table storage. |


## Remarks

Can only be ran by users with write permission on the semantic model and not when live connected to the semantic model in Power BI Desktop. This function can be used in [DAX queries](/dax/dax-queries), and can't be used in calculations.

## Example 1 - DAX query

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view):

```dax
EVALUATE
	INFO.TABLESTORAGES()
```

This DAX query returns a table with all of the columns of this DAX function.

## Example 2 - DAX query with joins

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

```dax
EVALUATE
	VAR _INFO =
	INFO.TABLESTORAGES()

	VAR _ModelTables = 
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.TABLES(),
			"TableID", [ID],
			"Table Name", [Name]
		)
	VAR _ModelStorageFolders = 
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			INFO.STORAGEFOLDERS(),
			"StorageFolderID", [ID],
			"Storage Folder Path", [Path]
		)

	VAR _CombinedTable1 =
	NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN(
		_INFO,
		_ModelTables
	)
	VAR _CombinedTable2 =
	NATURALLEFTOUTERJOIN(
		_CombinedTable1,
		_ModelStorageFolders
	)
	
	RETURN
		SELECTCOLUMNS(
			_CombinedTable2,
			"Table Storage ID", [ID],
			"Table Storage Name", [Name],
			"Table Storage Version", [Version],
            "Table Name", [Table Name],
			"Storage folder Path", [Storage Folder Path]
			)
			
	ORDER BY [Table Storage Name]
```

This DAX query returns a table with only the specified columns and joining to other INFO DAX functions and the table storages table.
