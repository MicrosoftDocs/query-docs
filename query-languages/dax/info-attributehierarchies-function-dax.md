# INFO.ATTRIBUTEHIERARCHIES

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-query-only](includes/applies-to-query-only.md)]

Returns a table with information about each attribute hierarchy in the semantic model. This function provides metadata about the attribute hierarchies defined in the model.



## Syntax

```dax
INFO.ATTRIBUTEHIERARCHIES ( [<Restriction name>, <Restriction value>], ... )
```

[!INCLUDE[parameters-for-info-dax-functions](includes/parameters-for-info-dax-functions.md)]

## Return value

A table whose columns match the schema rowset for attribute hierarchies in the current semantic model:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| [ID] | A reference to the object. IDs are usually autogenerated and should not be changed after the model is created. Data type is unsigned long (4 bytes). |
| [ColumnID] | An ID-based reference to a Column object. |
| [State] | A value that provides information about the state of the AttributeHierarchy object. The possible values and their interpretation are as follows: **Ready (1)** – The Attribute Hierarchy is queryable and has up-to-date data. **CalculationNeeded (4)** – The Attribute Hierarchy does not contain any data because it was not refreshed. There is no error associated with the attribute hierarchy. **DependencyError (7)** – The column that is associated with this Attribute Hierarchy is in an error state (SemanticError, EvaluationError, or DependencyError).|
| [AttributeHierarchyStorageID] |An ID-based reference to an AttributeHierarchyStorage object, which can be enumerated with [INFO.ATTRIBUTEHIERARCHYSTORAGES](/dax/info-attributehierarchystorages-functions.dax.md) |
| [ModifiedTime] | The time that the object was last modified. |
| [RefreshedTime] | The time that the object was last refreshed.

## Remarks

- Typically used in DAX queries to inspect and document model metadata.
- Permissions required depend on the host. Querying full metadata may require model admin permissions.

## Example DAX query

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view):

```dax
EVALUATE
    INFO.ATTRIBUTEHIERARCHIES()
```

This DAX query returns a table with all of the columns of this DAX function.
