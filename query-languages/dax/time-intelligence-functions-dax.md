# Time intelligence functions

Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) includes time-intelligence functions that enable you to manipulate data using time periods, including days, months, quarters, and years, and then build and compare calculations over those periods. Before using any time-intelligence functions, make sure to mark one of the tables containing date column as Date Table.
