# New DAX functions

DAX is continuously being improved with new functions and functionality to support new features. New functions and updates are included in service, application, and tool updates which in most cases are monthly.

While functions and functionality are being updated all the time, only those updates that have a visible and functional change exposed to users are described in documentation. New functions and updates to existing functions within the past year are shown here.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all functions are supported in all versions of Power BI Desktop, Analysis Services, and Power Pivot in Excel. New and updated functions are typically first introduced in Power BI Desktop, and then later in Analysis Services, Power Pivot in Excel, and tools.
