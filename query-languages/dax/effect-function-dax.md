# EFFECT

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Returns the effective annual interest rate, given the nominal annual interest rate and the number of compounding periods per year.

## Syntax

```dax
EFFECT(<nominal_rate>, <npery>)
```

### Parameters

|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|nominal_rate|The nominal interest rate.|
|npery|The number of compounding periods per year.|

## Return Value

The effective annual interest rate.

## Remarks

- EFFECT is calculated as follows:

    $$\text{EFFECT} = \bigg( 1 + \frac{\text{nominal\_rate}}{\text{npery}} \bigg)^{\text{npery}} - 1$$

- npery is rounded to the nearest integer.

- An error is returned if:
  - nominal_rate â‰¤ 0.
  - npery < 1.
