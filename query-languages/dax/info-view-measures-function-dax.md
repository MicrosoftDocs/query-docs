# INFO.VIEW.MEASURES

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Returns a table with information about each measure in the semantic model, such as name, description, and DAX formula. This information helps you understand the model and to self-document the model when used in calculated tables. 

## Syntax

```dax
INFO.VIEW.MEASURES()
```

## Return value

A table with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| [ID] | The unique ID for each measure in this semantic model as an integer. |
| [Name] | The name of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |
| [Table] | The home table of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |
| [Description] | The description of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |
| [DataType] | The data type of each measure in this semantic model as a string. Measures are usually variant data type. |
| [Expression] | The DAX formula of each measure in this semantic model. |
| [FormatString] | The format string of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |
| [IsHidden] | The hidden state of each measure in this semantic model as True or False. |
| [State] | The state (such as valid or error) of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |
| [KPIID] | The KPI ID of each measure in this semantic model as an integer. |
| [IsSimpleMeasure] | The simple measure flag of each measure in this semantic model as True of False. |
| [DisplayFolder] | The display folder of each measure in this semantic model as a string. Nested folders shown with / and multiple folders separated by ;. |
| [DetailRowsDefinition] | The details rows definition  of each measure in this semantic model. |
| [DataCategory] | The data category  of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |
| [FormatStringDefinition] | The dynamic format string  of each measure in this semantic model. |
| [LineageTag] | The lineage tag  of each measure in this semantic model as a string. |

## Remarks

Can only be ran by users with write permission on the semantic model and not when live connected to the semantic model in Power BI Desktop. This function can be used in calculated tables, columns, and measures of a semantic model and will update when the model is refreshed.

## Example 1 - DAX query

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view):

```dax
EVALUATE
	INFO.VIEW.MEASURES()
```

This DAX query returns a table with all of the columns of this DAX function.

## Example 2 - DAX query with SELECTCOLUMNS

The following DAX query can be run in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

```dax
EVALUATE
	SELECTCOLUMNS(
		INFO.VIEW.MEASURES(),
		"Home table", [Table],
		"Measure", [Name],
		[Description],
		"DAX formula", [Expression],
		[State]
	)
```

This DAX query returns a table with only the specified columns and rows meeting the filter condition with a DAX formula.

## Example 3 - calculated table with SELECTCOLUMNS

Either of the above examples work in a calculated table when the EVALUATE and ORDER BY keywords are removed and a table name added. Here is example 2 in a calculated table:

```dax
Measures in this semantic model = 
SELECTCOLUMNS(
		INFO.VIEW.MEASURES(),
		"Home table", [Table],
		"Measure", [Name],
		[Description],
		"DAX formula", [Expression],
		[State]
	)
```
This calculated table shows the same information as the DAX query in example 2 in a table in the model itself.

## Example 4 - measure

The following measure can be added to count the number of text columns in a semantic model:

```dax
Number of measures = 
COUNTROWS( INFO.VIEW.MEASURES() )
```
This will show a scalar value with the number of measures in my model.

This can be shown in a visual:

Or a DAX query in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

```dax
DEFINE
    MEASURE 'Measures in this semantic model'[Number of measures] = COUNTROWS( INFO.VIEW.MEASURES() )

EVALUATE
    SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
        "Number of measures", [Number of measures]
    )
```
