# Write DAX queries with Copilot

You can use Copilot to write and explain Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) queries in DAX query view of a Power BI semantic model. 

## Enable Copilot

Check to make sure you meet the [Fabric Copilot requirements](/fabric/get-started/copilot-fabric-overview#enable-copilot). 

### Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, in the **Preview features** section of the **Options**, enable **DAX query view with Copilot**.

1. Open Power BI Desktop.
1. Open an existing Power BI report or connect to published semantic model as live edit or live connection. Alternatively, you can add data and create a new semantic model and report.
1. Go to **DAX query view**, the fourth view available on the left side of Power BI Desktop.
1. Create a new query tab.
1. Open Copilot by clicking on the **Copilot** button or using <kbd>CTRL + I</kbd>.

### Power BI service or workspace

1. Choose a published semantic model in a workspace.
2. From the context menu choose **Write DAX queries**. If **Write DAX queries** is greyed out, you may need to enable **Users can edit data models in the Power BI service (preview)** in the **Power BI** **General** section of **Workspace settings**.
3. Create a new query tab.
4. Open Copilot by clicking on the Copilot button or using <kbd>CTRL + I</kbd>.

> [!NOTE]
> DirectQuery and Direct Lake model authors can also use DAX query view. View the data in your tables whenever you want.

## Use Copilot

Let’s look at what Copilot can help you with in [DAX query view](/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view): 

- **Natural language to DAX query**. Just ask for what you want from your semantic model and have the DAX query generated by Copilot. You can also select an existing DAX query and have Copilot modify it.
- **DAX query to natural language**. Ask Copilot to explain what any DAX query is doing. 
- **Understand DAX concepts**. Maybe you heard about a certain DAX function or need to find the right DAX function for the job. Copilot can help you here too.

To use Copilot to create a DAX query, type in a prompt to describe what DAX query you would like generated and select **Send** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Alternatively, you can click the **Write DAX query** inspire button. To run what is returned, select **Run** or press <kbd>F5</kbd> to see the results of the DAX query. To keep the query and exit Copilot, select **Keep query** to add it to query tab. 

To use Copilot to explain a DAX query, select the DAX query and click the **Explain this query** inspire button. A short explanation is shown with the option to **show more** to see a longer explanation. 

To use Copilot to explain a DAX topic, click the **Explain a DAX topic** inspire button, or type in a prompt to ask for an explanation of a DAX function or topic and select **Send** or press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A short explanation is shown with the option to **show more** to see a longer explanation. 

## Features of the inline Copilot

### 1. Run the DAX query before you keep it

You can **Run** the DAX query then decide to **Keep** or **Discard** the DAX query. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/copilot-run-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of running the DAX query before you save it." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/copilot-run-query.png":::

### 2. Build the DAX query conversationally

After the initial DAX query is generated, you can simply adjust by typing in additional user prompts. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/copilot-explain-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of asking DAX to explain the query." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/copilot-explain-query.png"::: 

### 3. Syntax checks on the generated DAX query

The generated DAX query syntax is checked, and the prompt automatically retried once. If the retry is also invalid, the generated DAX query is returned with a note that there is an issue, giving you the option to rephrase your request or fix the generated DAX query:

"This query contains errors. Rephrase your request and try again or try fixing it yourself."

### 4. Inspire buttons to get you started with Copilot
 
Type in a prompt or select any of these buttons to see quickly what you can do with Copilot.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/copilot-inspire-buttons-get-started.png" alt-text="Screenshot of showing Copilot offers suggestions." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/copilot-inspire-buttons-get-started.png"::: 

## Sample prompts

These sample prompts can illustrate how to use Copilot to write DAX queries.

- [Write a DAX query](#write-a-dax-query)
- [Add a column with the diff view](#add-a-column-with-the-diff-view)
- [Explain a DAX query](#explain-a-dax-query)
- [Explain a DAX topic](#explain-a-dax-topic)

### Write a DAX query

In a blank query tab, invoke Copilot with <kbd>CTRL+I</kbd> and enter this request:

"Write a DAX query to show profit by product"

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-list-products.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Copilot with the prompt Write a DAX query to show profit by product." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-list-products.png":::

After a few moments I get a DAX query. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-query-list-products.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing DAX query generated by Fabric Copilot." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-query-list-products.png":::

I can select **run** to see the results before I keep the query.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-run-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Run DAX query generated by Fabric Copilot." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-run-query.png":::

I can conversationally make updates to my initial request. Type in "Add in Orders" and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> and Copilot adds in the additional measure. I can again **run** the query to see the results.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-conversational-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to build the DAX query conversationally." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-conversational-query.png":::

When I select **keep query**, the query is added to the query tab. 

### Add a column with the diff view

Let's now add a column to the existing DAX query. First I select the DAX query, then invoke Copilot. This time the selection is showing fitted to the text and the background shading highlights what is being sent with the request to Copilot. Type in this request, and hit <kbd>enter</kbd>:

"Add a column to show profit per order"

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-show-diff.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a selection included with the Copilot prompt." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-show-diff.png":::

Now the diff styling in the DAX query editor shows exactly what Copilot has changed.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-highlight-diff.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing diff styling to see what Copilot has changed." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-highlight-diff.png":::

I select **run** to see the results, and **keep query** to add it to the query editor. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-updated-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the query in the DAX query editor." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-updated-query.png":::

### Explain a DAX query

Copilot can provide a detailed explanation of a DAX query. Again, select the entire DAX query and invoke Copilot. This time select the **Explain this query** button. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Explain to me what this query does." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-query.png":::

Now, instead of writing DAX queries, it’s responding in the inline Copilot. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-query-explanation.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing brief explanation of the query.":::

Copilot generates a few lines. I select **Show more** to see the full explanation.

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-query-more.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a long explanation of what the query does.":::

Now I understand each part and the DAX functions used.

### Explain a DAX topic

Copilot can also explain DAX functions with more detail. Let's ask about SUMMARIZECOLUMNS. In a new query tab, invoke Copilot, and sent the following request: 

"Explain what SUMMARIZECOLUMNS is for"

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-summarize-columns.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an explanation of what the SUMMARIZECOLUMNS does." lightbox="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-explain-summarize-columns.png":::

Again, Copilot generates brief description: 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-summarize-columns-brief.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a brief description of the SUMMARIZECOLUMNS DAX function.":::

I can select **Show more** to see a more detailed explanation with an example. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dax-copilot/dax-copilot-summarize-columns-more.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Copilot generates a much more in-depth description.":::

The example also uses columns in my model.
