  - A table expression that returns a single column of date/time values.  
  - A Boolean expression that defines a single-column table of date/time values.  
  
- Constraints on Boolean expressions are described in the topic, [CALCULATE function](calculate-function-dax.md).  
  
- When the current context is a single date, the date returned by the FIRSTDATE and LASTDATE functions will be equal.
