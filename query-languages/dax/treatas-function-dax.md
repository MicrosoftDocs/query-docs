# TREATAS

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Applies the result of a table expression as filters to columns from an unrelated table. 
  
## Syntax  
  
```dax
TREATAS(table_expression, <column>[, <column>[, <column>[,â€¦]]]} )  
```
  
### Parameters  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|table_expression|An expression that results in a table.|
|column|One or more existing columns. It cannot be an expression. |  

## Return value  

A table that contains all the rows in column(s) that are also in table_expression.
  
## Remarks

- The number of columns specified must match the number of columns in the table expression and be in the same order.

- If a value returned in the table expression does not exist in the column, it is ignored. For example, TREATAS({"Red", "Green", "Yellow"}, DimProduct[Color]) sets a filter on column DimProduct[Color] with three values "Red", "Green", and "Yellow". If "Yellow" does not exist in  DimProduct[Color], the effective filter values would are "Red" and "Green".

- Best for use when a relationship does not exist between the tables. If you have multiple relationships between the tables involved, consider using [USERELATIONSHIP](userelationship-function-dax.md) instead.

## Example

In the following example, the model contains two unrelated product tables. If a user applies a filter to DimProduct1[ProductCategory] selecting Bikes, Seats, Tires, the same filter, Bikes, Seats, Tires is applied to DimProduct2[ProductCategory].

```dax
CALCULATE(
SUM(Sales[Amount]), 
TREATAS(VALUES(DimProduct1[ProductCategory]), DimProduct2[ProductCategory])
)
```
