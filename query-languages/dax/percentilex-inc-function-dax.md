# PERCENTILEX.INC

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]
  
Returns the percentile number of an expression evaluated for each row in a table.  
  
To return the percentile of numbers in a column, use [PERCENTILE.INC](percentile-inc-function-dax.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```dax
PERCENTILEX.INC(<table>, <expression>;, k)  
```
  
### Parameters  
  
|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|table|The table containing the rows for which the expression will be evaluated.|  
|expression|The expression to be evaluated for each row of the table.|  
|k|The desired percentile value in the range 0 to 1 inclusive.|  
  
## Return value

The percentile number of an expression evaluated for each row in a table.  
  
## Remarks

- If k is zero or blank, percentile rank of 1/(n - 1) returns the smallest value. If zero, it is out of range and an error is returned.  
  
- If k is nonnumeric or outside the range 0 to 1, an error is returned.  
  
- If k is not a multiple of 1/(n - 1), PERCENTILEX.EXC will interpolate to determine the value at the k-th percentile.  
  
- PERCENTILEX.INC will interpolate when the value for the specified percentile is between two values in the array. If it cannot interpolate for the k percentile specified, an error is returned.
