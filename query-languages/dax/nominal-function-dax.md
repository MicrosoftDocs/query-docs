[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Returns the nominal annual interest rate, given the effective rate and the number of compounding periods per year.

## Syntax

NOMINAL(<effect_rate>, <npery>)
```

### Parameters

|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|effect_rate|The effective interest rate.|
|npery|The number of compounding periods per year.|

## Return Value

The nominal annual interest rate.

## Remarks

- The relationship between NOMINAL and EFFECT is shown in the following equation:

    $$\text{EFFECT} = \Big( 1 + \frac{\text{nominal\_rate}}{\text{npery}} \Big)^{\text{npery}} - 1$$

- npery is rounded to the nearest integer.

- An error is returned if:
  - effect_rate â‰¤ 0.
  - npery < 1.
