# SAMPLEAXISWITHLOCALMINMAX

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Returns a sample subset from a Table that is obtained by binning the primary X-axis into equal-sized bins and preserving the local min/max for each bin across different series.

## Syntax

```dax
SAMPLEAXISWITHLOCALMINMAX(<Size>, <Table>, <Axis>, <Measure>, [<Measure> [, ...] ], <MinResolution> [, <DynamicSeries> [, <DynamicSeries [, ...] ] ] [, <DynamicSeriesSelectionCriteria] [, <DynamicSeriesSelectionOrder] [, <Max Resolution>] [, <MaxDynamicSeries>] [, <MaxIterations>]) 
```

### Parameters

|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|Size|Number of rows in the sample to return|
|Table|Any DAX expression that returns a table of data from where to return a sample subset from.|
|Axis|The numerical or datetime column from Table to be binned.|
|Measure| Column reference from Table to be sampled. At least one Measure is required, but you can specify multiple.|
|MinResolution| Minimum number of selected rows that spans the full non-empty range of X|
|DynamicSeries| (Optional) Column to be used as series. You can specify zero, or or multiple.|
|DynamicSeriesSelectionCriteria| (Optional) Decides which series values to retain if not all DynamicSeries can be preserved. Valid values are NONE or ALPHABETICAL|
|DynamicSeriesSelectionOrder| (Optional) Decides to use ascending or descending sorting on the criteria identified by DynamicSeriesSelectionCriteria. Valid values are ASC or DESC.|
|MaxResolution| Maximum number of selected rows for a line that spans the full non-empty range of X|
|MaxDynamicSeries|Maximum allowed DynamicSeries. If the number of DynamicSeries is higher than MaxDynamicSeries remove DynamicSeries based on DynamicSeriesSelectionCriteria.|
|MaxIterations|Maximum number of iterations to try to reach the Size number of rows.

## Return Value

The sample from Table consisting of Size number of rows.

## Remarks
- if the number of rows in Table are less than the specified Size, then no binning will occur and all rows will be returned.
- The selected bin-sizes will be less than MinResolution
- SAMPLEAXISWITHLOCALMINMAX is used by Power BI to reduce the number of points in a line chart with a continuous (numeric) X-axis.

## Example

The following DAX query:

```dax
EVALUATE
SAMPLEAXISWITHLOCALMINMAX(
	10,
	SELECTCOLUMNS ( Sales, "x", [Unit Price], "y", [Sales Amount] ),
    [x],
    [y],
	10
	)
```

Returns a 10 row (or less) sample subset of Table that is binned by Unit Price and sampled on Sales Amount.
