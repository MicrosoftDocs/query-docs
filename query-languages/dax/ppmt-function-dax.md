# PPMT

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations](includes/applies-to-measures-columns-tables-visual-calculations.md)]

Returns the payment on the principal for a given period for an investment based on periodic, constant payments and a constant interest rate.

## Syntax

```dax
PPMT(<rate>, <per>, <nper>, <pv>[, <fv>[, <type>]])
```

### Parameters

|Term|Definition|  
|--------|--------------|  
|rate|The interest rate for the loan.|
|per|Specifies the period. Must be between 1 and nper (inclusive).|
|nper|The total number of payment periods in an annuity.|
|pv|The present value â€” the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.|
|fv|(Optional) The future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be BLANK.|
|type|(Optional) The number 0 or 1 which indicates when payments are due. If type is omitted, it is assumed to be 0. The accepted values are listed below this table.|

The **type** parameter accepts the following values:

| **Set type equal to** | **If payments are due**        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 0 or omitted          | At the end of the period       |
| 1                     | At the beginning of the period |

**Note:** For a more complete description of the arguments in PPMT, see the PV function.

## Return Value

The payment on the principal for a given period.

## Remarks

- Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at an annual interest rate of 12 percent, use 0.12/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 0.12 for rate and 4 for nper.

- type is rounded to the nearest integer.

- An error is returned if:
  - per < 1 or per > nper
  - nper < 1
