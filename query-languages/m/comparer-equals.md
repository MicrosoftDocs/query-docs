# Comparer.Equals

## Syntax

<pre>
Comparer.Equals(comparer as function, x as any, y as any) as logical
</pre>

## About

Returns a `logical` value based on the equality check over the two given values, `x` and `y`, using the provided `comparer`.

`comparer` is a `Comparer` which is used to control the comparison. A comparer is a function that accepts two arguments and returns -1, 0, or 1 based on whether the first value is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. Comparers can be used to provide case-insensitive or culture and locale-aware comparisons.

The following built-in comparers are available in the formula language:

* [Comparer.Ordinal](comparer-ordinal.md): Used to perform an exact ordinal comparison
* [Comparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase](comparer-ordinalignorecase.md): Used to perform an exact ordinal case-insensitive comparison
* [Comparer.FromCulture](comparer-fromculture.md): Used to perform a culture-aware comparison

## Example 1

Compare "1" and "A" using "en-US" locale to determine if the values are equal.

**Usage**

```powerquery-m
Comparer.Equals(Comparer.FromCulture("en-US"), "1", "A")
```

**Output**

`false`
