# Binary.Buffer

## Syntax

<pre>
Binary.Buffer(<b>binary</b> as nullable binary) as nullable binary
</pre>

## About

Buffers the binary value in memory. The result of this call is a stable binary value, which means it will have a deterministic length and order of bytes.

## Example 1

Create a stable version of the binary value.

**Usage**

```powerquery-m
Binary.Buffer(Binary.FromList({0..10}))
```

**Output**

`#binary({0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10})`
