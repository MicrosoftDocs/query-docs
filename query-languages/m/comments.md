# Comments

You can add comments to your code with single-line comments `//` or multi-line comments that begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.

**Example - Single-line comment**

```powerquery-m
let
   //Convert to proper case.
    Source = Text.Proper("hello world")
in
    Source
```

**Example - Multi-line comment**

```powerquery-m
/* Capitalize each word in the Item column in the Orders table. Text.Proper
is evaluated for each Item in each table row. */
let
    Orders = Table.FromRecords({
        [OrderID = 1, CustomerID = 1, Item = "fishing rod", Price = 100.0],
          [OrderID = 2, CustomerID = 1, Item = "1 lb. worms", Price = 5.0],
          [OrderID = 3, CustomerID = 2, Item = "fishing net", Price = 25.0]}),
        #"Capitalized Each Word" = Table.TransformColumns(Orders, {"Item", Text.Proper}) 
in
        #"Capitalized Each Word"
```
