# Table.View

## Syntax

<pre>
Table.View(<b>table</b> as nullable table, <b>handlers</b> as record) as table
</pre>

## About

Returns a view of `table` where the functions specified in `handlers` are used in lieu of the default behavior of an operation when the operation is applied to the view.

If `table` is provided, all handler functions are optional. If `table` isn't provided, the `GetType` and `GetRows` handler functions are required. If a handler function isn't specified for an operation, the default behavior of the operation is applied to `table` instead (except in the case of `GetExpression`).

Handler functions must return a value that is semantically equivalent to the result of applying the operation against `table` (or the resulting view in the case of `GetExpression`).

If a handler function raises an error, the default behavior of the operation is applied to the view.

**Table.View** can be used to implement folding to a data source&mdash;the translation of M queries into source-specific queries (for example, to create T-SQL statements from M queries).

Refer to the published [Power Query custom connector documentation](/power-query/samples/trippin/10-tableview1/readme#using-tableview) for a more complete description of **Table.View**.

## Example 1

Create a basic view that doesn't require accessing the rows in order to determine the type or the row count.

**Usage**

``` powerquery-m
Table.View(
    null,
    [
        GetType = () => type table [CustomerID = number, Name = text, Phone = nullable text],
        GetRows = () => Table.FromRecords({[CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"]}),
        GetRowCount = () => 1
    ]
)
```

**Output**

`Table.FromRecords({[CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"]})`
