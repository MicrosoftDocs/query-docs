# Quick tour of the Power Query M formula language

This quick tour describes creating Power Query M formula language queries.

> [!NOTE]
> M is a case-sensitive language.

## Create a query with the Power Query editor

To create an advanced query, you use the [Power Query advanced editor](/power-query/power-query-ui#the-advanced-editor). A mashup query is composed of variables, expressions, and values encapsulated by a `let` expression. A variable can contain spaces by using the # identifier with the name in quotes as in `#"Variable name"`.

A `let` expression follows this structure:

```powerquery-m
let
   Variablename = expression,
   #"Variable name" = expression2
in
   Variablename
```  

To create an M query in the advanced editor, you follow this basic process:

1. Create a series of query formula steps that start with the `let` statement. Each step is defined by a step variable name. An M _variable_ can include spaces by using the # character as `#"Step Name"`. A formula step can be a custom formula. Note that the Power Query formula language is case sensitive.

2. Each query formula step builds upon a previous step by referring to a step by its variable name.

3. Output a query formula step using the `in` statement. Generally, the last query step is used as the in final data set result.

To learn more about expressions and values, go to [Expressions, values, and let expression](expressions-values-and-let-expression.md).

## Simple Power Query M formula steps

Let's assume you created the following transform in the Power Query editor to convert product names to the appropriate case, in this instance, to all initial capitalization.

To begin with, you have a table that looks like this:

|:::no-loc text="OrderID":::|:::no-loc text="CustomerID":::|:::no-loc text="Item":::|:::no-loc text="Price":::|
|-----------|--------------|--------|---------|
|1|1|:::no-loc text="fishing rod":::|100|
|2|1|:::no-loc text="1 lb. worms":::|5|
|3|2|:::no-loc text="fishing net":::|25|

And, you want to capitalize the first letter in each word in the Item column to produce the following table:

|:::no-loc text="OrderID":::|:::no-loc text="CustomerID":::|:::no-loc text="Item":::|:::no-loc text="Price":::|
|-----------|--------------|--------|---------|
|1|1|:::no-loc text="Fishing Rod":::|100|
|2|1|:::no-loc text="1 Lb. Worms":::|5|
|3|2|:::no-loc text="Fishing Net":::|25|

The M formula steps to project the original table into the results table look like this in the Power Query advanced editor:

:::image type="content" source="media/madvancededitor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Power Query advanced editor with all of the M formula steps to produce the table and capitalize initial letters.":::

Here's the code you can paste into the Power Query advanced editor:

```powerquery-m
let Orders = Table.FromRecords({
    [OrderID = 1, CustomerID = 1, Item = "fishing rod", Price = 100.0],
    [OrderID = 2, CustomerID = 1, Item = "1 lb. worms", Price = 5.0],
    [OrderID = 3, CustomerID = 2, Item = "fishing net", Price = 25.0]}),
    #"Capitalized Each Word" = Table.TransformColumns(Orders, {"Item", Text.Proper})
in
    #"Capitalized Each Word"
```

Letâ€™s review each formula step.

1. **Orders**: Create a table with data for Orders.

2. **#"Capitalized Each Word"**: To capitalize each word, you use [Table.TransformColumns](table-transformcolumns.md).

3. **in #"Capitalized Each Word"**: Output the table with the first letter of each word capitalized.
