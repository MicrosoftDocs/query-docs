# Salesforce.Reports

## Syntax

<pre>
Salesforce.Reports(optional <b>loginUrl</b> as nullable text, optional <b>options</b> as nullable record) as table
</pre>

## About

Returns the reports on the Salesforce account provided in the credentials. The account will be connected through the provided environment `loginUrl`. If no environment is provided then the account will connect to production (https://login.salesforce.com). An optional record parameter, `options`, may be provided to specify additional properties. The record can contain the following fields:

* `ApiVersion`: The Salesforce API version to use for this query. When not specified, API version 29.0 is used.
* `Timeout`: A duration that controls how long to wait before abandoning the request to the server. The default value is source-specific.
