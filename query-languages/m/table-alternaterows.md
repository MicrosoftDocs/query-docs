</pre>
  
## About

* `table`: The input table.
* `offset`: The number of rows to keep before starting iterations.
* `skip`: The number of rows to remove in each iteration.
* `take`: The number of rows to keep in each iteration.

Table.AlternateRows(
    Table.FromRecords({
        [CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"],
        [CustomerID = 2, Name = "Jim", Phone = "987-6543"],
        [CustomerID = 3, Name = "Paul", Phone = "543-7890"]
    }),
    1,

Table.FromRecords({
    [CustomerID = 1, Name = "Bob", Phone = "123-4567"],
