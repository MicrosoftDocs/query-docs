# DateTime.FixedLocalNow

## Syntax

<pre>
DateTime.FixedLocalNow() as datetime
</pre>
  
## About

Returns a `datetime` value set to the current date and time on the system. This value is fixed and will not change with successive calls, unlike [DateTime.LocalNow](datetime-localnow.md), which may return different values over the course of execution of an expression.
