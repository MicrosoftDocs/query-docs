## About

Returns a table of SQL tables and views available in a Db2 database on server `server` in the database instance named `database`. The port may be optionally specified with the server, separated by a colon. An optional record parameter, `options`, may be specified to control the following options:

- `CreateNavigationProperties`: A logical (true/false) that sets whether to generate navigation properties on the returned values (default is true).
- `NavigationPropertyNameGenerator`: A function that is used for the creation of names for navigation properties.
- `Query`: A native SQL query used to retrieve data. If the query produces multiple result sets, only the first will be returned.
- `CommandTimeout`: A duration that controls how long the server-side query is allowed to run before it is canceled. The default value is ten minutes.
- `ConnectionTimeout`: A duration that controls how long to wait before abandoning an attempt to make a connection to the server. The default value is driver-dependent.
- `HierarchicalNavigation`: A logical (true/false) that sets whether to view the tables grouped by their schema names (default is false).
- `Implementation`: Specifies the internal database provider implementation to use. Valid values are: "IBM" and "Microsoft".
- `BinaryCodePage`: A number for the CCSID (Coded Character Set Identifier) to decode Db2 FOR BIT binary data into character strings. Applies to Implementation = "Microsoft". Set 0 to disable conversion (default). Set 1 to convert based on database encoding. Set other CCSID number to convert to application encoding.
- `PackageCollection`: Specifies a string value for package collection (default is "NULLID") to enable use of shared packages required to process SQL statements. Applies to Implementation = "Microsoft".
- `UseDb2ConnectGateway`: Specifies whether the connection is being made through a Db2 Connect gateway. Applies to Implementation = "Microsoft".

The record parameter is specified as [option1 = value1, option2 = value2...] or [Query = "select ..."] for example.
