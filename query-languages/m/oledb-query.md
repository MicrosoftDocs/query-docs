# OleDb.Query

## Syntax

<pre>
OleDb.Query(<b>connectionString</b> as any, <b>query</b> as text, optional <b>options</b> as nullable record) as table
</pre>

## About

Returns the result of running `query` with the connection string `connectionString` using OLE DB. `connectionString` can be text or a record of property value pairs. Property values can either be text or number. An optional record parameter, `options`, may be provided to specify additional properties. The record can contain the following fields:

* `ConnectionTimeout`: A duration that controls how long to wait before abandoning an attempt to make a connection to the server. The default value is driver-dependent.
* `CommandTimeout`: A duration that controls how long the server-side query is allowed to run before it is canceled. The default value is ten minutes.
* `SqlCompatibleWindowsAuth`: A logical (true/false) that determines whether to produce SQL Server-compatible connection string options for Windows authentication. The default value is true.
