# List.Generate

## Syntax

<pre>
List.Generate(<b>initial</b> as function, <b>condition</b> as function, <b>next</b> as function, optional <b>selector</b> as nullable function) as list
</pre>

## About

Generates a list of values using the provided functions. The `initial` function generates a starting candidate value, which is then tested against `condition`. If the candidate value is approved, then it's returned as part of the resulting list, and the next candidate value is generated by passing the newly approved value to `next`. Once a candidate value fails to match `condition`, the list generation process stops. An optional parameter, `selector`, may also be provided to transform the items in the resulting list.

## Example 1

Create a list by starting at ten, repeatedly decrementing by one, and ensuring each item is greater than zero.

**Usage**

```powerquery-m
List.Generate(() => 10, each _ > 0, each _ - 1)
```

**Output**

`{10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`

## Example 2

Generate a list of records containing x and y, where x is a value and y is a list. x should remain less than 10 and represent the number of items in the list y. After the list is generated, return only the x values.

**Usage**

```powerquery-m
List.Generate(
    () => [x = 1, y = {}],
    each [x] < 10,
    each [x = List.Count([y]), y = [y] & {x}],
    each [x]
)
```

**Output**

`{1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`
