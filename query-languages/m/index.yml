title: Power Query M formula language
summary: Microsoft Power Query provides a powerful data import experience that encompasses many features. Power Query works with desktop Analysis Services, Excel, and Power BI workbooks, in addition to many online services, such as Fabric, Power BI service, Power Apps, Microsoft 365 Customer Insights, and more. A core capability of Power Query is to filter and combine, that is, to mash-up data from one or more of a rich collection of supported data sources. Any such data mashup is expressed using the Power Query M formula language. The M language is a functional, case sensitive language similar to F#.
