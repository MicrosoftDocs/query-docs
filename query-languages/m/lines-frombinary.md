## About

Converts a binary value to a list of text values split at line breaks.

* `binary`: The binary value to convert to the list.
* `quoteStyle`: Specifies how line breaks are handled. The value of `quoteStyle` can be `null`. The default value is [QuoteStyle.None](quotestyle-type.md).
* `includeLineSeparators`: Specifies whether to include the line break characters in the text. The value of `includeLineSeparators` can be `null`. The default value is `false`.
* `encoding`: Specifies the text encoding of the binary value. The value of `encoding` can be `null`. The default value is `65001` (UTF-8).

If a record is specified for `quoteStyle` (and `includeLineSeparators` and `encoding` are `null`), the following record fields can be provided:

* `QuoteStyle`: Specifies how quoted line breaks are handled.
  * [QuoteStyle.Csv](quotestyle-type.md): Quoted line breaks are treated as part of the data, not as the end of the current row.
  * [QuoteStyle.None](quotestyle-type.md): All line breaks are treated as the end of the current row, even when they occur inside a quoted value. This value is the default if the `CsvStyle` option isn't specified.
* `CsvStyle`: Specifies how quotes are handled. Should not be used with `QuoteStyle.None`.
  * [CsvStyle.QuoteAfterDelimiter](csvstyle-type.md): Quotes in a field are only significant immediately following the `Delimiter.
  * [CsvStyle.QuoteAlways](csvstyle-type.md): Quotes in a field are always significant, regardless of where they appear.
* `Delimiter`: A single character delimiter. Should be used only with `CsvStyle.QuoteAfterDelimiter`.
* `IncludeLineSeparators`: Specifies whether to include the line break characters in the text. The default value is `false`.
* `Encoding`: The text encoding of the binary value. The default value is `65001` (UTF-8).
